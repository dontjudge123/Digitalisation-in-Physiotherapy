<p>
The current digital transition, which is having a significant impact on the healthcare industry, can be considered as a major issue in our contemporary society. While some medical specialties, like radiology, have already been significantly impacted by technological advancements, others that require physical examinations, like orthopedics, are still in the early stages of digital adaption. The field of physiotherapy is becoming more and more influenced by digital influences as it deals with close and frequent patient interaction as well as a variety of transportable digital knowledge.Utilizing electronic documentation can assist monitor measured physical parameters like range of motion (ROM) and improve labor productivity by standardizing workflow. Studies have revealed that a physiotherapeutic examination of the knee using digital tools (such as telehealth) appears to be possible and reliable in the setting of telehealth. Additionally, telemedicine provides the opportunity to contact a large number of patients, cut expenses, and provide access to patients in remote locations. Telehealth has been found to be equally beneficial as traditional hands-on treatment for surgery patients in some contexts. As a result, telehealth can improve patient satisfaction and health outcomes. Another key digital area is mobile health applications (mHealth), which have been shown to provide highly effective support for physiotherapeutic treatment.

<p>
Wearable technology and mobile apps can be used together to monitor patients in real time and in great detail. A recent study shown that physiotherapists have favorable sentiments toward mHealth tools. However, a number of studies have revealed that patients and physiotherapists alike are generally concerned about data security, which continues to be a drawback of digitization.Along with numerous innovative digital tools and techniques, the discipline of physiotherapy also faces significant difficulties. For instance, some patient populations, such young children or the elderly, may find it challenging to use telehealth. Additionally, digital practices are not sufficiently reimbursed in some countries since health insurance companies do not recognize them. The legal structure, however, can be anticipated to be progressively adjusted as the healthcare system rapidly digitizes.
</p>
Digitalization has been incredibly important, particularly during the SARS-CoV-19 outbreak. There is a clear demand for new digital tools as seen by the rising usage of telehealth as a result of governmental regulations and to protect both personnel and patients.The purpose of the current study was to determine how physiotherapists felt about digitalization and how much before the Covid-19 outbreak, digital aspects had already begun to ingrain themselves into their routine employment. Additionally, we sought to pinpoint variables that affected participants' sentiments, such as gender, place of employment, age, and - potentially biasedly - whether they participated online or in hard copy (mode of participation).Early revolutionary developments in physical therapy include the following:

<ol>
<li><strong>Electrical Neuromuscular Stimulation (NMES)</strong>. Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation, which was first described in medical treatment literature in 1964, uses
 electrical impulses to target a particular muscle region to help patients regain range of motion and strength after an injury or surgery.</li>
<li><strong>Laser Therapy at Low Levels (LLLT)</strong>. Since its inception in 1967, lower-level laser therapy has been used to promote tissue regeneration and reduce inflammation, providing pain relief to patients with a variety of musculoskeletal diseases including osteoarthritis, TMD, and disc herniation.</li>
<li><strong>Telemedicine/Tele-Rehab</strong>. Since 1998, telerehabilitation has provided patients with a means to get specialized physical therapy services using a webcam and an internet-enabled device.</li>
</ol>

<strong>What Technologies Are Used in Physical Therapy?</strong>
In physical therapy, a wide range of technology is used to account for patient treatment services and administrative purposes. Electronic medical records (EMR), mobility testing equipment, ultrasound, and muscle testing equipment are examples of this technology.
Any physical therapy practice that wants to streamline and simplify its operations needs a solid EMR solution. With efax capabilities and on-the-go administrative capabilities, this all-in-one solution enables physical therapy practices to stay in compliance and go paperless by leveraging fast electronic patient documentation and management.

<ol>
<li><strong>Motion Capture Tech</strong>
A university in singapore created a Motion Capture Technology called Precise Marker Less that helps doctors and Physiotherapists for the consultations and diagnosis of the patients who need treatment after an injury or ongoing rehabilitation. Motion Capture Tech is based upon Machine Learning, and can perform several functions at one place. Mainly this technology helps in Marker-free motion capture (mocap) systems now on the market have been demonstrated to be less precise than current technology, which can offer 3D anatomical bone landmark positions with an accuracy of 10-15 millimeters, or roughly the breadth of an adult's little finger. </li>
<li><strong>Virtual reality VR</strong> 
VR is these days very popular amongst digitization of health and implementation of medical surgeries. VR can help in remotely practicing vaious rehabilitation methods of surgeries. Patients can perform excercises or movements at home by the use of VR, VR can also use easily tailored softwares that help in performing , tracking and implementation of movements. </li>
<li><strong>Telehealth</strong>
OTPs can employ telehealth to assess patients, intervene as needed, educate patients, and prevent illness from getting worse. </li>
Digitally assisted care has the potential to improve patient management, health habits, and treatment satisfaction, all of which lead to better health outcomes and health system performance. Scalable DHIs can also overcome access and cost obstacles and can be tailored to fit the requirements and expectations of patients and clinicians. Nonetheless, research on DHI acceptability, adoption, and efficacy is limited , owing in part to the complexity and diverse nature of DHIs, as well as the lack of a standardized Digital Health Intervntion categorization system that is easily understood by both patients and health care professionals (HCPs). Furthermore, while research on DHI acceptability exists, assessing involvement with digital health requires more broad and thorough methods of evaluation than those now available.

<H1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>

Therefore Digitization of Medical sector has helped us a lot in carrying out medical treatments at the space of our choice and on fingerprints. This is super useful during Pandemic like Covid-19. Physiotherapy is getting digitized day by day with the help of AI and there is much more innovation to come in the future.
